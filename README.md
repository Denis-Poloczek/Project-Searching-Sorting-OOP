# Project-Searching-Sorting-OOP

## Introduction
This project is a Python-based application that demonstrates the implementation and usage of various searching and sorting algorithms in an object-oriented programming framework. It's designed for educational purposes, providing an interactive console application to explore different algorithms.

## Features
- Implementation of multiple sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, QuickSort, and Bucket Sort.
- Implementation of various searching algorithms: Linear Search, Jump Search, Binary Search, Interpolation Search, and Exponential Search.
- Interactive console-based user interface for selecting and running sorting and searching methods.
- OOP principles applied for modular and scalable code design.

## File Structure
- `application_brain.py`: Core logic for user interaction and application state management.
- `main.py`: Entry point of the application, orchestrating the user interface and process flow.
- `searching_manager.py`: Contains implementations of various searching algorithms.
- `sorting_manager.py`: Contains implementations of various sorting algorithms.
- `class_data.py`: Stores data structures like method dictionaries and ASCII art.
- `manager.py`: Base class providing common functionalities for managers.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Installation
